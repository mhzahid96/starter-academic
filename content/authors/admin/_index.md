I'm a research data analyst at Stanford University's ECHOLab housed under the Center on Food Security and the Environment. My research intersts lie at the intersection of the environment, health, and develpoment economics. Specifically, I'm interested in how environmental factors causally affect social and economic outcomes, and what are the important impact channels and mechanisms to assess how communities and individuals can adapt or respond. I have coauthred papers estimating the impacts of cleft lip/palate on life outcomes of adolescent patients in India, the impacts of biomass burning on infant mortality, quantifying climate change loss and damage. I use this space to post my published work, working papers, and occadionally post about a topic of interest.
