I'm a PhD student at the <a href="https://erg.berkeley.edu">Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley</a>. My research interests focus on uncovering the mechanisms behind environmental degradation and its subsequent effects on humans. Additionally, I am interested in evaluating the effectiveness of solutions implemented to remediate or mitigate environmental degradation. Previously, I worked as a research data analyst at Stanford University's <a href="http://echolabs.squarespace.com">ECHOLab</a>, housed within the <a href="http://fse.fsi.stanford.edu">Center on Food Security and the Environment</a>. I have coauthored papers estimating the impacts of cleft lip and palate on life outcomes for adolescent patients in India, the effects of biomass burning on infant mortality, the quantification of climate change loss and damage, and the degree of climate adaptation globally across multiple sectors.
I use this space to share my published work, working papers, and occasionally write about topics of interest (see "Posts").
