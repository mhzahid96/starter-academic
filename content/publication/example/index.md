abstract: Dear Dr. Suri, 

I hope this email finds you well.

Iâ€™m so excited to have been paired with you! I cannot wait to learn from you and share my passion for research, development, and economics with you!

I had the pleasure of reading your work in the past and have always been inspired by it! I remember reading your work on M-Pesa around the time I decided to pursue development economics as a field. I was always fascinated by how mobile money and its use can be a tool to facilitate development. 

I wish you all the best in the remaining days of 2020 and a great start in the upcoming year!
Mustafa
