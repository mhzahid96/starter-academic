## Overview
Climate Change Public Opinion in the Arab World 

A couple of months ago, I came across an email from the Arab Barometer series of summary results from their 2018-2019 fifth wave survey. This time it was results from the newly added questions on the public opinion regarding environmental issues, specifically water pollution, climate change, and waste. The results indicated that although there is differences between countries, there is no difference across demographic characteristics. So I wondered what drives public opinion regarding climate change in the Arab world?

Data Availability
The first challenge I have encountered is that there is not enough data. When looking for documented public opinion regarding climate change in the Arab world, there is no consistent survey that asks a representative sample about their opinions. The only representative survey that exist comes from one year, which is the last iteration/wave of surveys from the Arab Barometer.

Climate Change in the Arab World
Ramifications of climate change has been taking place around the world for years now. The MENA region is no exception. The MENA region stands to be one of the most affected from climate change and its ramifications, given its arid and semi-arid environment. Ramifications of climate change can materialize in a host of ways. For example increase in average temperature, and or extreme weather events, as well as shifting precipitation patterns. Such changes in the natural system can have big impacts on the social outcomes of the communities residing in affected areas. 
Let‚Äôs take temperature for example. The data shows a steady increase in average yearly temperature from the start of the century up to 2016.There is growing evidence form multiple studies on the negative impacts of increased temperature a multitude of outcomes (health, education, productivity to say a few). 
Here are a few example of climate change ramifications: (link to youtube vids)
         - Example from locusts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo61TiAGwhk
 
Data on people‚Äôs opinion:
So what can we learn from the data on public opinion? There is considerable differences between countries. A quick look at the number across gender lines, age categories, and urban-rural divide does not yield any insights, as the percent of people believing in the seriousness of climate change does not change. A caveat of this data is not all the countries are included. Namely there are only 12 countries out of 22 Arab countries. But countries with higher temperature seem to have a higher percentage of people believing in the seriousness of climate change. Additionally, the higher the gdp per capita is, the lower percentage of people believing in seriousness of climate change. 

Adaptation and mitigation are two approaches in the face of climate change taken by institutions to lessen the intensity of climate change or its impact on peoples lives. Wealthier nations have bigger capacity to take on adaptation policies for example. Adaptation for example can come in the shape of high penetration of AC in a given country. High capacity to adopt to high temperature or extreme shifting weather patterns combined with low percentage of dependence on agriculture for livelihood can lead to minimal exposure to ramifications of climate change. 

To better understand the differences in opinion let us focus on a specific country.When looking at the data within Lebanon, the two regions with the highest percentage of people believing in the seriousness of climate change are Al Bekaa and Mount Lebanon. There are a lot of factors that can come in play in shaping these opinions, but a quick look at these two regions can showcase some patterns into the potential determinants of public opinion. 

Drought in Al Bekaa Valley 
35 percent of Lebanon‚Äôs land is cultivated, and half of that land is in the Bekaa region. Most crops in the Bekaa region are rain-fed. Al Bekaa and Mount Lebanon account for almost 40 percent of number of farm holdings in Lebanon,

The Bekaa Valley represents around 40 percent of the cultivated land in Lebanon. In 2012, agriculture accounted for 15 percent of exports and imports in Lebanon. In areas where most agriculture products are produced, agriculture accounts for 80 percent of GDP. Al Bekaa is Lebanon‚Äôs most important farming region. It is also home of industries that are directly linked to farming. Of the ramifications of climate change that have been affecting the region is the decline in rainfall, increase in drought events.

Wildfires in Mount Lebanon:
The second region with the highest percentage of people believing in the seriousness of climate change is Mount Lebanon. Alongside the agricultural importance of this region, Mount Lebanon has seen a number of wildfires, most recently in October of this year. Increased occurrence of heat waves due to climate change, accompanied with drought events, leads to more wildfires like the one witnessed this year.

So for both these regions, we can see how direct exposure to climate change ramifications can affect public opinion. And maybe the relatively lower number of people believing in the seriousness of climate change in some areas could be explained by the fact that climate change as a term can include multiple scenarios or manifestations, and thus the relative abstract-ness of the word might lead people to disassociate from its seriousness. For example when looking at more tangible issues like water pollution or trash issues, a higher percentage of all respondents believe in the seriousness.

Conclusion: 
There is not enough data to identify trends in public opinion regarding climate change  or utilize difference across time to deduce drivers of climate change. However there is some indications that across country variation can depend on capacity to adopt to ramifications of climate change, and that within country variation can be explained by rate of dependence on agriculture, due to direct exposure to climate change ramifications. 

But does public opinion matters? And why is it important to understand its drivers? Maybe its 
not. But aside from the interesting insights that can be deduced from such exercise, it can also teaches something about what shapes people beliefs about certain phenomena such as climate change. And although strong opinion towards climate change does not necessity translate to action or pressure on actors to bring about certain mitigation policy, it can form a basis for such actions.
